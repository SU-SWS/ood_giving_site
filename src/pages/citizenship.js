            The federal government requires institutions of higher education,
            such as Stanford, to report gifts and other payments from a donor
            who is not a U.S. citizen when that donor makes gifts and other
            payments to Stanford with an aggregate value of $250,000 or more in
            a calendar year. Stanford must also report gifts and other payments
            received from a donor who is associated with one of certain specific
            countries (the list, which may change over time, currently includes
            China (while excluding Hong Kong), Russia, Iran, and North Korea),
            when that donor makes gifts and other payments to Stanford having an
            aggregate value of $50,000 or more during a reporting period that
            runs from July 1 to June 30 of the following year. Because your
            generous gift(s) meet one or both of these reporting thresholds, we
            ask that you please provide the information requested below. Thank
            you.
          </p>
          <p>
